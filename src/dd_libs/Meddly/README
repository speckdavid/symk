To create a branch or a tag: copy the entire "trunk" subdirectory to
an appropriately-named subdirectory at the same level.

Subdirectories:
---------------

docs/         Generated docs from source code, for users (include files only)
docs-devel/   Generated docs from source code, for developers (all source files)
examples/     Stand-alone applications that use the library
src/          Library source code
tests/        Test applications used by "make check"
visual/       Visualization utilities that work with the library.

Building the library:
---------------------

You will need g++, autoconf, automake and libtool.

0. If you obtained the library via svn:
   $ ./autogen.sh
   This will create the configure script and Makefiles.
   Run this the first time, and whenever the source code has changes in
   its file or directory layout.

1. $ ./configure
   This will setup the build files.
   Can be used to set various compile options; 
   see "Configuration Options" below.
   An alternate would be:
   $ ./configure --prefix=/other/install/location
   (See "make install" further down for reasons).

2. $ make
   Build the library.
   Library will be in src/. Applications in src/ and examples/. This may be
   sufficient for most users.

3. $ make install
   Library in lib/, include files in include/.  This can be changed
   in step (1) by selecting an alternate location, for example using
    --prefix=/usr/local
   will install libraries in /usr/local/lib and headers in /usr/local/include.
   If you reconfigure, make sure you run "make clean" before running "make".

4. $ make uninstall
   Removes the files installed in bin/ and lib/.

5. $ make clean
   Removes the results of compilation from src/ and examples/.

Build the documentation:
------------------------

0. Need to have doxygen installed.

1. $ cd docs

2. If you see docs/html/index.html and docs/refman.pdf, your docs have
   already been built and you can ignore the rest of the steps. Otherwise:
   $ make
   This will create the folders docs/html and docs/latex.
   docs/html: HTML documentation. See index.html.
   docs/latex: Tex-based documentation. See refman.tex.
     If you have latex installed:
     a. $ cd latex
     b. $ make
        This will create refman.dvi.
     c. $ make pdf
        This will create refman.pdf (using ps2pdf).

3. $ make clean
   Removes docs/ and html/.

4. Technical documentation can be generated the same way, in docs-devel/

Configuration Options
---------------------
Several environment variables may be set before running configure.
For example, to build an optimized version of the library:

$ ./configure CXXFLAGS="-O3"

To build a debuggable version of the library:

$ ./configure CPPFLAGS="-DDEVELOPMENT_CODE" CXXFLAGS="-ggdb"

To set the location of the gmp library, by hand 
(only necessary if ./configure fails to find it):

$ ./configure CPPFLAGS="-I/path/to/gmp/header" LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/gmp/lib"

To disable gmp support in Meddly:

$ ./configure --without-gmp
